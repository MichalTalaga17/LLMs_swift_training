# LLMs_swift_training

A collection of tools, scripts, and examples for training Large Language Models (LLMs) with a focus on Swift and Apple platforms.

## Overview

This repository provides resources for training, fine-tuning, and experimenting with LLMs using Swift. Whether you're interested in building Swift-based LLM pipelines, integrating LLMs into your iOS/macOS apps, or running experiments with custom datasets, this project aims to help you get started quickly and efficiently.

## Features

- Swift scripts and utilities for preprocessing text data.
- Example projects showing LLM inference and fine-tuning in Swift.
- Integration guides for using LLMs in iOS/macOS apps.
- Sample datasets for experimentation.
- Jupyter notebooks and Swift Playgrounds for interactive exploration.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Xcode 14+ or Swift 5.7+
- Python 3.8+ (for some preprocessing scripts)
- [Swift for TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift) or other ML libraries (optional, depending on your use case)
